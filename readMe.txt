RainbowKu is a rainbow-themed sudoku game that has all the features of a normal sudoku app and more!

To run this app, you will need to download the following libraries:
  cmu_graphics
  itertools
  PIL

After downloading the libraries, open the file 'sudoku-newUI.py' and change:
  lines 22, 24, 30, 32, 38, 40, 46, 48, 54, 56, 62, 64 to reflect the path of the folder names "boards"
  lines 412 and 414 to reflect the path of the file named "custom-11-26.txt"
  line 857 to reflect the path of the file named "originalImage.png"
  line 860 to reflect the path of the file named "finishedImage.png"
  line 864 to reflect the path of the file named "savedSudoku.pdf"

This is the only file you will need to open.

After making the above changed, run the app. From there, you can find a list of controls in the instructions page.
